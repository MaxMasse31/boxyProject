# Learning Project - Udemy React Tutorial

This project is part of my learning journey on Udemy, following the tutorial "[React de A Ã  Z](https://www.ecole-du-web.net/p/react-de-a-a-z)".

## About

This repository contains code and materials that I've used to practice and learn React from the tutorial. It may include various exercises, projects, and examples as I progress through the course.

## Note

This is not a production-ready or fully polished project. It's primarily for educational purposes and personal practice.
